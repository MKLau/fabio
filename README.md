### Forestry and Agriculture Biomass Input-Output Tables

This repository provides the data and scripts resulting from our work on a set of physical supply-use and input-output tables covering global agriculture and forestry. The work is fully based on freely available data from FAOSTAT, IEA, EIA and UN Comtrade.

FABIO now covers 191 countries, 116 processes and 130 commodities for 1986-2013. The code was released here: https://github.com/sru-wu/fabio. An R package is in preparation.
